## Basic Knowledge
Java is a Object-Oriented Programming Language. This means that Java is written based on classes and not on functions or procedures like in C.
It is a compiled language, meaning that it requires a compiler which you can download from https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html. 
Code is written in a ```.java ``` file which is compiled by the compiler using the command 
```sh 
javac YourProgramName.java
```
This gives a new file with the same name but with a ```.class``` extension. You can run this by:
```sh 
java YourProgramName
```
_Make sure that the .class extension is not included in the command above_
